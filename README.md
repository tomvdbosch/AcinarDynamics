# AcinarDynamics
Matlab code to simulate dynamics in the acinar pancreas as published in Lodestijn et al. (2021) Cell Stem Cell

Simulations can be run by simply downloading all code, adding to the search path in Matlab and running the main.m script.
Best fits for parameters are described in the paper. Sampling data to convert 3D acini to 2D measurements are found in the supplemental data of the paper and Figure 2E.
